        "## Project overview\n",
        "This notebook builds and evaluates a chatbot for a **high-stakes genomics / genome sequencing** domain.  \n",
        "The goal is to compare three system designs and measure how each one behaves under **normal**, **ambiguous**, and **adversarial** user prompts.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this domain, the biggest risk is not just incorrect answers, but **confident, authoritative responses that normalize or enable harmful uses** (e.g., eugenics-like “enhancement” requests). Our evaluation therefore focuses on both helpfulness and safety.\n",

        "## Objectives\n",
        "By the end of this notebook we will:\n",
        "1. Curate a small ground-truth corpus of public governance / ethics / policy documents for genomics.\n",
        "2. Implement three chatbot modes:\n",
        "   - **Retrieval-only**: returns only cited excerpts from the corpus (no free-form synthesis).\n",
        "   - **RAG**: uses retrieval (top-*k* passages) + an LLM to produce a cited answer.\n",
        "   - **LLM-only**: answers without retrieval (used as a baseline).\n",
        "3. Run a structured evaluation across prompt types and settings, then analyze:\n",
        "   - **Correctness / support** (is the answer backed by the corpus?)\n",
        "   - **Hallucination rate** (unsupported claims)\n",
        "   - **Safety behavior** (abstain / refuse when appropriate)\n",
        "   - **Failure modes** (especially under ambiguity and prompt injection)\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key knobs\n",
        "- **Mode**: `retrieval_only` | `rag` | `llm_only`  \n",
        "- **Top-k retrieval** (RAG only): `k ∈ {2, 5}`  \n",
        "- **Temperature**: `0.0` (deterministic) vs `0.7` (more creative / riskier)\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",

        "## Inputs\n",
        "- A curated corpus of ~10 documents (policy / ethics / governance).  \n",
        "- A test set of **30 prompts** split into:\n",
        "  - Normal (clear, answerable)\n",
        "  - Ambiguous (missing info; best behavior may be abstain/clarify)\n",
